# Docs

This document contains required interim work submitted as part of my dissertation. It’s not the final report, which I’m frankly not proud of (neither am I of the overall state of the project). But, this does include the all the citations from the report itself.

While it contains less academic jargon, it still provides a glimpse into my thoughts on the project after the initial proposal stage. I had to cut quite a lot out to fit the academic setting and time frame.

Yes, things have changed quite a bit since this document was submitted, but it’s still quite close enough.
